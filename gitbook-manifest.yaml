summary: |
  Skip the walls of text and static screenshots. Educate your users by embedding interactive demos in your documentation.

  Capture a demo simply by clicking through a flow with the HowdyGo extension. Edit the flow and captured UI with our no-code editor. Embed it right in your documentation.

  # How it works

  Simply paste the share link from a HowdyGo demo into your GitBook page. The integration will automatically convert the link into an embedded demo.

  # Configure

  To configure the HowdyGo integration for your spaces, navigate to "Integrations" and select "Manage Spaces" > "Enable for all spaces" (or select a specific space).
